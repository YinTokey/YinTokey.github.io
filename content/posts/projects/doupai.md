Doupai is a video editing tool that helps users create engaging videos and quickly share them on social media. Launched in 2014, closed in 2023, it ranked top 1 in the Apple Store multiple times. 

There is an English version introduction https://apptopia.com/ios/app/1441388905/about  (More lightweight than the Chinese version)

I was primarily responsible for iOS video editing and UI development. Most of the time, I independently built iOS UI components and collaborated with other team to integrate the video rendering engine. 


From February 2021 to May 2021, during a major version update, I had the opportunity to lead a team of 3 iOS engineers. I oversaw the development process, coordinated with the engine team, and mentoring team members to understand and work with the complex video editing system.
